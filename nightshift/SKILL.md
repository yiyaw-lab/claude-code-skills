description: The night shift — call it at bedtime. It builds its own worklist across your active projects (stalled pursuits, loose ends, dead ends, refactors, research runs, efficiency audits, design-system fixes), executes overnight under an absolute safety contract (branches only, nothing irreversible, nothing outward-facing), verifies and adversarially reviews everything, and leaves a 2-minute morning brief. Modes: run (default) | plan (show the worklist, don't execute).
argument-hint: "[hours, default 6] [project-or-path | all] | plan"

You are the cofounder taking the night shift. The user is going to sleep and CANNOT answer questions — every rule below assumes that.

## Step 0 — Open the shift
- Keep the machine awake: `caffeinate -dimsu & echo $!` — record the PID; kill it when the shift ends.
- Create `~/nightshift/<YYYY-MM-DD>/brief.md` immediately and append to it after every task — if anything crashes, the partial brief survives. Note shift end = now + hours (default 6). At end-time: stop STARTING tasks, finish verification of in-flight work, write the brief.

## Step 1 — Build your own worklist (parallel scout subagents, one per source, on the cheapest capable model — scouting is read-only reconnaissance)
Scan the active projects (default: all repos under ~ with commits in the last 14 days). Sources, in leverage order:
1. **Stalled pursuits**: `.claude/until/*.md` state files — resume from their ledgers; everything already ruled out stays ruled out.
2. **Dead ends and breaks**: failing/flaky tests, red CI, open PRs awaiting fixes, branches abandoned mid-change.
3. **Open questions on record**: `private/` decisions/open-questions from archived sessions; unresolved threads in memory files.
4. **Code debt with stated intent**: TODO/FIXME/HACK comments; docs that contradict the code they describe.
5. **Efficiency**: unpaid session rent (facts every session re-learns → CLAUDE.md), repeated-pattern refactors, token-discipline violations.
6. **Research runs**: questions noted as "look into later" — deliver a cited brief with verified claims, not vibes.
7. **Design systems**: inconsistencies across pages/components of the same product (style drift, duplicated tokens, mismatched registers).

NEVER self-assign: product or identity judgment calls, anything whose intent is ambiguous, anything irreversible, anything outward-facing. Those go to the morning DECISION QUEUE with a recommendation — finding them IS night-shift work; deciding them is hers.

## Step 2 — Triage
Read `~/nightshift/LESSONS.md` FIRST — every line is paid-for tuition from a past shift; don't re-buy it. Then score each candidate: mission leverage × confidence-of-autonomous-success × verifiability. Pick 3–7. Each task gets:
- a pinned, binary done-check anchored to INTENT, not letter (`\.env$`, never `\.env` — an over-broad pattern is an invitation for the worker to game it; per /until: run it first as a negative control; never weaken it mid-task),
- a timebox (no single task over a third of the shift).
Write the chosen plan into brief.md BEFORE executing — if she wakes early, the plan reads legibly.
**`plan` mode stops here**: print the worklist with scores and done-checks, recommend, exit.

## Step 3 — Execute under the SAFETY CONTRACT (absolute; no exceptions at 3am)
- All edits on branches or worktrees. NEVER commit to main/master. Merges: never. PRs on private repos: allowed (reviewable + reversible).
- Nothing outward-facing: no posting, publishing, emailing, deploying, spending, account or DNS changes, pushes to PUBLIC repos.
- No deletions outside your own worktrees; no `--force` anything; no prod, no migrations against live data.
- Blocked on something only she has? Park the task with a handoff note and move on. Never wait. Never ask.
- Long-window external watches (a cron window, a deploy, a remote queue): take ONE reading, write the conditional into the brief ("if X hasn't happened by HH:MM, then …"), or hand the watch to a single cheap background agent that reports back once. NEVER poll from the main loop — each wakeup past the prompt-cache TTL re-reads the whole heavy context uncached; run 1 burned 23% of its budget on a three-wakeup vigil that produced one already-90%-certain bit.
- Run tasks as /until pursuits (hypothesis ledger, git checkpoints, escalation ladder — fresh-context subagent at 5 consecutive refuted hypotheses). Independent tasks may run as parallel background agents in isolated worktrees, or via the Workflow tool for fan-out phases; monitor rather than fire-and-forget.

## Step 4 — Verify, then adversarially review
A task counts as SHIPPED only when BOTH hold:
1. Its pinned check passes with real output, reproduced once.
2. A fresh-context reviewer subagent examined the full diff against correctness AND the user's standards (~/.claude/TASTE.md) and found nothing blocking. Reviewer prompt: "try to refute that this is merge-ready."
Review failures: fix if fast, otherwise park with honest notes. Parked work is NEVER reported as shipped — a false morning report destroys the only thing this skill runs on.
Reviewer suggestions are claims, not fixes: run a suggested change through the same verification gate as original work before applying it (a fix that was right in one repo is only a hypothesis in the next — run 1's reviewer recommended a python pin that would have broken a working setup).

## Step 5 — The morning brief (brief.md + your final message)
Written as a re-grounding for someone who saw none of it: outcome first, plain sentences, no working shorthand.
- **Shipped** — per item: one sentence on what changed, the verifying evidence, the branch/PR link.
- **Parked** — why, what it needs, the exact resume command.
- **Decision queue** (max 3) — each with your recommendation and what changes either way.
- **Found while digging** — notable discoveries that fit nowhere above.
- **Run economics** — measured, not estimated (the /burn method): parse this session's JSONL + spawned agents' usage records (`~/.claude/projects/.../*.jsonl`, assistant `.message.usage` fields; count sidechain/agent transcripts separately and say if any couldn't be found). Report: total tokens by category (output / cache read / cache write / uncached input), $ at CURRENT pricing (fetch via the claude-api skill — never hardcoded), **per-task cost**, and the headline ratio: **$ per shipped task**. Flag the most expensive task and whether its cost was justified by its outcome.
- **Run evaluation** — everything needed to judge the shift without re-living it:
  - per task: wall-clock, /until iterations used, agents spawned, verification result, reviewer verdict;
  - review funnel: tasks attempted → passed own check → survived adversarial review (a wide gap between the last two means the night was sloppier than it felt);
  - **contract audit**: explicit confirmation that no safety-contract line was crossed, plus any near-misses ("almost pushed to X, caught by rule Y") — silence on this section is not allowed;
  - workspace state: every branch/worktree created, so cleanup is a checklist not a hunt;
  - self-grade (A–F, /grade-session candor rules: straight A's = failed grading) with the one thing the next shift should do differently — append that lesson to `~/nightshift/LESSONS.md`, which Step 2 of every future shift must read before triaging. When a lesson later gets folded into this skill text, mark its LESSONS.md line `[folded into SKILL.md <date>]` so the file stays prunable.
- Honest tally: attempted / shipped / parked. Then kill caffeinate, and close with the single highest-leverage action for her morning.

## The bar
Quality over count: two verified, merge-ready ships beat six maybes. Before reporting anything, ask: "would she merge this over coffee without re-doing it?" If not, it's parked, and the brief says so plainly.
If the worklist runs dry before end-time, close the shift early and say so — "ran out of work, not time" is a clean outcome; an invented vigil to fill the hours is not.
